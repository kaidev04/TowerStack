# TowerStack
TowerStack is an android game made for a school project. TowerStack is based off of the game Stack where the player stacks blocks on top of each other at the right timing to form a continous tower. Failing to line up the blocks with each other results in a failure.

A requirement for the school project was that it must be intended for kids between the age of 2-4. Hence, the design and functionalities of the game is limitied to preserve simplicity for the targeted age group.
